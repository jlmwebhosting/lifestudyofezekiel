        <p>Welcome to Life Study of Ezekiel</p>

<p>There is a chamber, probably within the north gate of the inner court, for the priests to wash the burnt offerings (v. 38). In preparing a burnt offering to be offered, a number of steps had to be followed. First the animal was killed, and then it was flayed, or skinned and cut into pieces. After this, the offering was washed. After being washed, the offering was ready to be burned. Washing, therefore, was the last step in the preparation of the burnt offering. The chamber here is not for killing the burnt offering; neither is the chamber for skinning the offering or for cutting it into pieces. Rather, the chamber is only for washing the burnt offering. This indicates that at this point in our experience, we are ready to be a burnt offering for God. Only when we are in resurrection and on a higher level, are we ready to be absolute for God.
Here in the inner court begins the life that is for God. We do not see this in the outer court. In the outer court we have the enjoyment of Christ. But in the inner court we have improvement and progress, for here we are in something that is more inward and also higher. Here the priests are ready to offer the burnt offering, meaning that they are ready to be absolute for the Lord.</p>

<p>THE WAY OF LIFE
Christians today talk much about the Body, the church, and the house of God, but most do not see the practical way to have the Body, the church, and the house of God. Ezekiel 37 clearly reveals that the only way, the unique way, is the way of life. Two dry sticks can grow together not by gifts or teachings but by life.
The Lord did not tell Ezekiel to exercise certain gifts or to teach. The Lord charged Ezekiel to prophesy, to utter, or speak forth, some words for God. As Ezekiel declared something to the dead ones for God, He blew upon them and they received breath. When the breath came into them, it became life to them. Then by the way of life the two dry sticks could grow together.
We can become one not by gifts or teachings but by life. Oh, we all need the blowing of the wind! Then we need to receive the breath, and the breath will become in us the life-giving Spirit. Then we will be able to grow in life.
Life is wonderful. It takes care of so many problems. Our physical body can overcome many problems simply because it is living. This is an illustration of the fact that what we need in the church life is life, not gifts or teachings. By life the dead branches can be enlivened and grow into each other. Then these branches will have the oneness that issues out of the growth in life. If we pay attention to gifts or teachings, we will be divided. We all need something better, something higher, and this better and higher thing is life.
First comes the blowing of the wind, which is followed by the breath and by the life-giving Spirit. This causes the dry bones to become alive and to become one. Finally, the bones become an army fighting the battle for the Lord. Likewise, the dry sticks become alive and grow together. By the growth in life they are one and no longer have any divisions. Throughout the years, here in the church in Los Angeles we have paid our attention not to gifts or to teachings but to life. If we had paid attention to gifts and teachings, we would have been divided again and again. But because we care for the Lord’s way of life, we are one.
ONENESS BY LIFE
We praise the Lord for the oneness in His recovery. Although we come from many different backgrounds, we are one. We are one not by gifts or teachings but by life. Among us we have many former ministers, pastors, missionaries, and Bible teachers, but all of these are now one in life. Because we have life and are in life, we are one. Now we are an army fighting the battle and we are a dwelling place for the Lord.
When the saints migrate for the spreading of the church life, they are an army fighting the battle. We cannot have proper migrations if we do not have oneness. It is very good that in the migrations saints come from different parts of the country to be one in a particular city. They come together to be one not in teachings or gifts but in life. Because we are one in life, we are both the army and the dwelling place of the Lord. The army is formed with dry bones which have been made alive, and the dwelling place with dry sticks which have been enlivened and joined together. Now no one is dry. Every part of the army and of the dwelling place is full of life and is living in oneness. This is the Lord’s recovery.
FURTHER JUDGMENT
Following chapter thirty-seven there are two further chapters which speak of further judgment. These chapters indicate that if we go on with the Lord in oneness as an army and as a dwelling place for the Lord on earth, He will take care of all our enemies.
We should not think that since we are an army we will have no enemies. Neither should we think that since we are one as the Lord’s dwelling place, we will have no battles. There is still an enemy, but the Lord will deal with him. In chapter thirty-five there is Edom, the enemy within, and in chapters thirty-eight and thirty-nine there is the enemy outside. We have to judge Edom, the old man, the enemy within us, but the Lord will take care of the enemies which are outside. We may have the assurance that as long as we are one, the Lord will fight the battle for us. He will deal with our enemy, who is also His enemy. Praise the Lord that we can be in the church life in peace and safety. As we deal with the inward enemy, the Lord will deal with the outward enemy, and a strong church life will be built up to be “an exceeding great army” and the Lord’s sanctuary on earth. Only when God has judged all the enemies can His people dwell peacefully without fear. When His people are in such a peaceful condition, the building up of the Lord’s dwelling place will be completed, and the Lord will have a place of rest among His people.</p>

<p>The Lord has a way to make these dead sticks one, and His way is the way of life. His way is to make the sticks alive and then to put them together so that they may grow together. This is very similar to grafting, in which two branches are joined and eventually grow together. This actually is what is mentioned here. The two sticks are like two branches. Formerly they had no life, but then they were made alive. Having been enlivened, they are now able to grow together and become one.
Whereas the bones are for forming the army, the sticks are for the building of the house of God. The sticks had been divided, but now they are one and are the dwelling place of God. Therefore, here we have both the army fighting the battle for God and the house of God as His dwelling place.</p>

<p>A NOISE AND A SHAKING
In this chapter Ezekiel prophesied twice, in verse 7 and again in verse 10. Verse 7 says, “So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.” Here we see that when Ezekiel prophesied there was a noise and a shaking.
Sometimes others complain that our meetings are too noisy. My answer is that if all were dry bones, everything would be quiet. There would be neither noise nor voice, only quietness. All the bones in the valley in Ezekiel 37 were quiet and motionless. But when Ezekiel came and prophesied, there was a noise and a shaking, and all the bones came together. I cannot explain why this happened. We do know, however, that when we come together in the meetings and make a joyful noise (Psa. 95:1), we are truly one.
Suppose we all came into the meeting and sat quietly for thirty minutes. Soon we would become critical of one another, and eventually we would lose our oneness. But when we shout joyfully to the Lord Jesus, praising Him and calling on His name, we are one. It may not sound nice to you, but the more we make noise in this way, the more we are one. If we get out of ourselves by calling on the Lord and praising Him, we will be one.</p>

<p>If we apply this matter to our spiritual experience, we may say that when God blows upon us, that is the wind; when we breathe the wind, it is the breath; and when the breath comes into us, it is the Spirit. First comes the wind and then the breath and then the Spirit. When Ezekiel prophesied, God blew the wind, the people received the breath, and the breath became the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).</p>

<p>RECOVERY THROUGH PROPHESYING
Praise the Lord that He did not leave us in our situation but came in to rescue us! However, the Lord did not come in directly to be our Shepherd, but, in keeping with Ezekiel 37, He came in through the prophesying of His word.
Many Christians have a mistaken understanding of prophesying, thinking that to prophesy is only to predict. But there is hardly any prediction in Ezekiel 37. Instead, the prophesying here is a matter of declaring something or speaking something forth. This indicates that prophesying in this chapter does not mainly mean to predict but to tell forth, to make some kind of declaration. When the Lord told Ezekiel to prophesy, He meant that Ezekiel should speak forth. The Lord told Ezekiel that when he prophesied, He would send the breath and the wind. When Ezekiel spoke forth, God gave people the Spirit. From this we can see clearly that the main meaning of prophesying is not to predict but to speak forth something for the Lord.
Other Christians think that to prophesy is to teach. But no matter how much one may teach dry bones, they remain dry bones. One may teach dry bones about the need for wind, breath, and the Spirit, but nothing happens to these bones. In this chapter Ezekiel neither predicted something to the dry bones nor taught them. On the contrary, when Ezekiel prophesied, he spoke something for God, and God followed him. As Ezekiel was prophesying, God was blowing upon the dry bones, sending the wind, the breath, and the Spirit.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 36:37-38 says, “Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock. As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord.” Here the Lord promised that He would bring in flocks of people. Although He has promised to do this, we still need to inquire of Him. This means that we need to pray for the increase, saying, “O Lord, flock people in. You promised this to us.”
In the past, whenever we prayed for an increase of number, the Lord answered. I feel that we need to pray more. The Lord promised, yet He needs our inquiring. He promised that He will increase our number by flocks of men, but we need to pray for this and ask Him to do it. I hope that the saints in all the local churches will pray definitely and specifically for the increase of numbers. We should never be content with our present number. Rather, we should all aspire to be doubled within a period of time. Thus, we need to pray, “Lord, flock people in.”
In 1963 in Los Angeles, we had only twenty to thirty people, but after we prayed for six months, the number was greatly increased. In Elden Hall we also prayed that the Lord would flock people in. We prayed, “Lord, bring flocks of men to us,” and the Lord heard this prayer. I feel that today we need to pray even more, standing upon and claiming Ezekiel 36:37-38 concerning the increase of numbers.
We should not say that numbers do not mean anything and that we do not care for numbers. We should not comfort ourselves with any failure in the matter of increase. We surely need the increase in numbers. We need to pray for the increase, claiming the Lord’s promise in Ezekiel 36. When some hear this, they may say that they care not for quantity but for quality. However, quality comes out of quantity. Therefore, we need to pray that the Lord will give us the increase and that He will bring in flocks of men.</p>

<p>BEING DEAD AND DRY BONES
Before God came in to renew us and regenerate us, we were like dead and dry bones. If we had only Ezekiel 36, we would realize that we were sinful and filthy, but we would not think that we were dead. Ezekiel 37 reveals that we were not only dead but that we were also dry bones. This indicates that God’s salvation is not only for those who are sinful but also for those who are dead.
In the sight of God, when we were fallen, either as a sinner or as a backslidden believer, we were dead and buried in a grave. We were in the “grave” of various sinful things and worldly entertainments. Before we were saved or before we were revived we were all buried in some kind of grave. We were sinful, dead, buried, and dried up. We had no blood, no flesh, no sinew, no skin—just dry bones. This is a picture showing what we were and where we were.</p>

<p>You may feel that it is difficult to discern the difference between your spirit and your heart. Instead of trying to analyze the difference, we can recognize the difference according to our experience. When we consider how sweet and precious the Lord Jesus is and how much He has done for us, we may become stirred in our emotion and say, “Lord Jesus, I love You!” This is an expression of our loving heart. But when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we can sense that deep within something other than our heart has been exercised. This is our spirit. Just as we know that we have two feet by using them to walk, we know that we have a spirit by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord. One of the best ways to use our spirit to contact the Lord is to call, “O Lord Jesus!” When we exercise our spirit in this way, we have the sense of something moving deep within our being. That something is our spirit.</p>

<p>THE OUTWARD RECOVERY AND THE INWARD RECOVERY
In the Lord’s recovery there are two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect, the outward recovery and the inward recovery. Suppose that you have fallen away from Christ, from the church life, and from the fellowship with the saints and have become involved with sinful, worldly things. But one day the Lord seeks you out and brings you back to Himself, to the church life, and to the fellowship with the saints. This is a recovery, but it is only an outward recovery, the outward aspect of the Lord’s recovery. However, at the same time the Lord does an inward work. He not only brings you back to the good land, but He also recovers you inwardly. To be recovered back to the church life and to the fellowship with Christ is only the outward aspect. You still need the inward aspect of the Lord’s recovery, which is covered in 36:22-30.</p>

<p>The recovery by life begins in chapter thirty-three, where God sets a watchman. This recovery continues in chapter thirty-four, where God Himself comes in to be the Shepherd to search for His people, to seek them out, to bring them back, and to cause them to enjoy the riches of Christ signified by the riches of the good land. Following this, in chapter thirty-five the Lord reminds us of the need to condemn our old man, which is signified by Edom. This is the reason that after chapter thirty there is another word concerning the judgment upon Edom. For the most part, God waits until judgment has been executed before He begins His work of recovery. However, in the process of recovery, there is still the need of God’s judgment. This is true, in particular, regarding Edom. Edom was judged in the previous section, but because the old man is very difficult to deal with, the judgment upon the old man must be repeated. Yesterday you might have condemned your old man and experienced judgment upon him. But today your old man may return to pay you a visit, perhaps in a nice way or in a subtle way. You have been recovered and you have been brought back to Christ as the good land and have entered into the rich enjoyment of Christ. You might have thought that your old man had been fully condemned and judged, but you did not realize that he has come back without giving you any notice and without asking for permission to visit you. Now as you are enjoying Christ, he is with you, hating your enjoyment of Christ and your enjoyment of the church life.
Ezekiel 35 says that Edom and his company were happy to see that Israel was desolate (vv. 12, 15). Edom was also waiting to possess the two nations of Israel and Judah, claiming them as belonging to Edom. To the Lord Edom was speaking nonsense, for He intended to exercise His judgment upon Edom once again.
We need to learn the lesson of judging Edom. While we are being recovered, we have to judge our old man again and again. The judgment upon Ammon, Moab, Tyrus, Zidon, and Egypt may be once for all, but the judgment upon Edom cannot be once for all. On the contrary, Edom, our old man, must be judged repeatedly until the day of the redemption of our body. This is the reason that between Ezekiel 34 and 36, which are wonderful chapters, there is a very negative chapter regarding the judgment upon Edom. Because Edom returns, the judgment upon him must be repeated. Although we have condemned him, judged him, and chased him away, he comes back. Therefore, we need to cooperate with the Lord to exercise once again His judgment upon the old man.
The genuine recovery of the Lord is not simply a matter of repenting, turning to the Lord, and enjoying the blessing of the Lord. There also needs to be a change in our life and nature. In His recovery, God needs to touch our heart and our spirit and thereby touch our life directly and change us in life and nature. Therefore, we need both the outward recovery described in Ezekiel 34 and the inward recovery described in Ezekiel 36. Because the recovery in Ezekiel 36 concerns our life and our nature and involves our heart and our spirit, chapter thirty-five is inserted to show the importance of judging our old man. In order to recover us and make us a new man, God must judge our old man, our old creation.</p>

<p>Causing the Evil Beasts to Cease out of the Land
Ezekiel 34:25a says, “I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land.” Here we are told that, under the Lord’s shepherding, all the evil beasts will be kept away from the Lord’s recovered people. According to Paul’s word in Acts 20:29 evil beasts (“fierce wolves”) refer to evil persons who disturb God’s people. In the proper church life there are no wolves, only lambs. In His recovery the Lord causes the evil beasts to cease.</p>

<p>When the Lord Jesus comes as the Shepherd, He comes also as the King. The issue of the Lord’s caring for us as our Shepherd is that we obey Him as our King and come under His kingship. The Lord is our Shepherd to be our King, and He is our King to be our Shepherd. On the one hand He shepherds us; on the other hand, He governs us. As we receive the Lord’s shepherding, we understand the Lord’s throne, kingdom, and authority. He is shepherding us with His care and supply so that we may be subject to His kingship and that He may set up His throne and His kingdom within us.</p>

<p>Judging between Rams and Goats
Verse 17 says, “And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.” Verses 18 through 21 continue the Lord’s word concerning His judging, and then verse 22 concludes, “Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.” This indicates that when we have experienced the Lord’s recovery by life—that is, when we have been brought back to the mountains, the rivers, and the pasture and have experienced rest and healing—there can be righteous judgments among us. When we were fallen or backslidden, we argued with others and blamed them for our situation. But after we have been revived, recovered by life, we begin to realize that we ourselves have been wrong. Only then will righteous judgments be made among us. Actually, only the Lord who shepherds us, supplies us, and heals us can make such judgments. Only after He gives us the life supply, binds up our wounds, and heals us can all the unjust things among us be cleared away.
However, if we lack the Lord’s supply, binding, and healing, we will condemn others, blame others, and complain about others. If we condemn and blame one another, we cannot be in harmony with one another. But as the Lord recovers us by life, we have genuine revival, we have the enjoyment of Christ, which causes us to be satisfied, restful, and peaceful, and we experience the Lord’s binding and healing. The One who nourishes us and supplies us causes us to have an accurate sense concerning our relationships with the brothers and sisters. When we have such a sense, we judge ourselves, and as a result we have a genuine oneness with the saints as the one flock.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 34:11 says, “For thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.” As the Shepherd, the Lord not only seeks but also searches. Because of our fallen condition, we were all buried under many evil things, so we needed God to search for us. In Luke 15 we have both the shepherd (signifying Christ as the Shepherd) seeking the lost sheep and the woman (signifying the Spirit) lighting the lamp and searching within the house for the lost coin. The prodigal son then was drawn home by the searching of the Spirit.
The Lord has done the same thing with us. He searched for us in order to save us and recover us. Before we were saved, we were buried under many sins, but the Lord Jesus sought us. Then after we were saved, we backslid into degraded Christianity, and we were buried under many things, such as doctrines, forms, and gifts. However, once again the Lord Jesus searched for us; He sought us out and brought us out. Now we are the ones who have been sought out by the Lord Jesus as the Shepherd. How is it possible for us to be here in the church life? This is not of us but absolutely of Him. We are here because as the Shepherd He sought and searched for us.</p>

<p>SETTING THE WATCHMAN
In His recovery by life, the first thing the Lord does is to set the watchman. Ezekiel 33:7 says, “So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.” A watchman is one who has been commissioned by God to give His people a warning, to sound the trumpet to cause God’s people to turn to Him and repent. The principle is the same in the New Testament, where God sent John the Baptist as a great watchman. When John the Baptist came, he sounded the trumpet of repentance, crying, “Repent!” (Matt. 3:1-2). In principle, Ezekiel voiced the same thing when he urged the people to turn from their evil ways. God did not want them to die; His desire was that they would turn and live. Concerning this, Ezekiel 33:11 says, “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?”</p>

<p>The purpose of God’s judgment is to bring in recovery. He does not exercise judgment apart from His purpose to recover something.</p>

<p>We need to remember that God’s judgment is based upon His righteousness, His holiness, and His glory. Whenever the condition among His people or in the world does not match His righteousness, holiness, and glory, God will exercise His judgment for the purpose of recovery. God wants to recover His people according to His righteousness, holiness, and glory. As we will see, whereas God’s judgment is by fire, God’s recovery is by life.</p>

<p>It is crucial that we deal with our old man. If we do not judge our old man, God will exercise His judgment upon us, making us low and “down” in spirit. If we judge our old man, not caring to be first or to have any position in the church, we will be happy in the church life, we will be “up,” and our spirit will be “high.” To be “down” means that we are under God’s judgment.
Because we go along with our natural man, in His judgment, sometimes God will even destroy us and make us desolate. When we are desolate, we have nothing fresh, new, living, and growing. Instead, we are like a desert. Desolation is the result of our going along with our natural man. The more we exercise our natural wisdom, the more desolate we will be. But if we judge our natural man, our spirit will rise up and will be fresh, living, and flourishing.
Our old man and our natural man surely need to be dealt with by God. We cannot be responsible for the “Ammonites,” the “Moabites,” the “Tyrians,” the “Zidionians,” and the “Egyptians,” but we can, and we should, be responsible for the “Edomites” and the “Philistines,” who signify our old man and our natural man. By God’s grace we need to deal thoroughly with the old man and with the natural man, not allowing them to carry out a destructive work in the church. First Corinthians 3:17a says, “If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him.” If our old man and our natural man destroy the church of God, God will destroy us with our old man and natural man. Regarding this, we need to learn to fear God.</p>

<p>Being a Sanctuary for a Little While
to Those in Captivity
God said that even in the captivity He would be a sanctuary to His people for a little while (11:16, lit.). He became not a permanent sanctuary like the one in Jerusalem but a temporary sanctuary to His captured and scattered people.
If you tell others that Christianity has become degraded, they may argue with you by saying that they have the Lord’s presence in their meetings. We must admit this fact. It is true that the Lord is a sanctuary for a little while to those in captivity. We should not say that they do not have the real presence of the Lord at all; rather, we should point out that this is only a temporary sanctuary. Here and there, in some homes and groups, they have the Lord’s presence in a temporary way as a temporary sanctuary. However, no one should be satisfied with a temporary sanctuary. The temporary sanctuary should be a calling back to Jerusalem, back to the permanent sanctuary.
Bringing Them Back to the Land
We praise the Lord that in His mercy He promised those in the captivity that one day He would bring them back to the land (11:17). The land to which He would bring them would be on the highest mountains of Israel (20:40). The high mountains typify the resurrected and ascended Christ. The Christ whom we experience and enjoy today in the local churches is very high, for He is the resurrected and ascended Christ.</p>

<p>Sometimes the coordination in the local churches is not straight but is somewhat crooked. For example, brother A might fellowship a matter with brother B and then ask him not to tell brother C about this matter. But brother B goes to brother C, passes on the information to him, and then asks him not to say anything about this to brother D. This kind of coordination is political. We should never play politics in the church life. If we say something to one brother, we should be able to say it to others as well. This means that our wings must be straight. Our coordination must be frank, sincere, earnest, and straight.</p>

<p>AS THE SOUND OF GREAT WATERS
If the situation of a local church is like that of the four living creatures described above, that church will be qualified and adequate to sound out the voice and to give a strong testimony. The voice will not be that of an individual person but will be like the sound of great waters. A particular believer may be spiritual and love the Lord very much, but if he is not coordinated with others, the voice of his testimony will be weak; it will not be like the voice of great waters. We need to look to the Lord that the testimonies of all the local churches would be like the great waters. One individual brother should not always speak something for the local church, but a coordinated body should sound the voice and give the testimony. Others will be astonished at this kind of voice, and they will say that the voice of this local church is like the sound of great waters.</p>

<p>AS THE VOICE OF THE ALMIGHTY
Verse 24 says also that this voice is the voice of the Almighty. It becomes the voice of God Himself. It is the voice of a corporate body, but eventually this voice becomes the voice of God. How marvelous!
The testimony of a local church should be like this. The voice in your local church should be the voice not of any individual but the voice of the Almighty.</p>

<p>If you should work at a job for several years and nothing happens for the Lord’s interests, this indicates that with you there is no move of the Lord. You may consider yourself spiritual and heavenly, but you are lacking the wheel. If there is no move of the Lord with you, it is questionable whether you have the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs. This may indicate that while you are at work, you are somewhat worldly and that you are not a proper human being; therefore, the move of the Lord is not with you. But if you have the eagle’s wings, the man’s hands, and the calf’s hoofs, there will surely be a wheel beside you. The move of the Lord will be with you.</p>

<p>The wheels were at the side of the faces of the living creatures (Ezek. 1:15). This indicates that if we would have the Lord’s move, we must first live out the Lord, expressing Him. If we live out the expression of Christ, we will have the wheel of the Lord’s move.</p>

<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that the wheels are full of eyes. As the wheel moves, it sees. The more it runs, the more it sees. If the wheel were to stop moving, it would stop seeing. This is the way the church should be today. We see by going on. The more we go on, the more we see. It may be that today we can see only to a certain extent, but tomorrow we will go on and see more. If we stop moving, we will stop seeing. We Christians should be a moving people. The church must move in order to see.</p>

<p>James 5:17 may help us to understand this. This verse tells us that Elijah prayed earnestly. Literally, the Greek words translated “prayed earnestly” mean “prayed in a prayer.” This indicates that a prayer from the Lord was given to Elijah, in which he prayed. He did not pray in his feeling, thought, intention, or mood, or in any kind of motivation, arising from circumstances or situations, to fulfill his own purpose. Rather, he prayed in the prayer given by the Lord for the accomplishing of His will. For Elijah to pray in a prayer means that there was a prayer within his prayer. This is the wheel within a wheel.</p>

<p>This is contrary to the concept, held by many believers, that we need to wait until the Lord moves before we can move. I have been burdened by the Lord to tell His children that there is no need for them to wait for the Lord to move. The Lord has been waiting for nearly two thousand years. If we go on, the Lord will follow us. If we do not exercise to move, there will be no wheel, but if we move, the wheels will follow us. The move of God’s work, the move of the gospel, and the move of the church all depend on our moving. We need to have the confidence, the assurance, and the faith to go on boldly. If we move on boldly, the wheels will follow us. Let us act boldly and move on to take this country and to take the earth.</p>

<p>Instead of having the expression of an eagle in their daily living, some believers may have the expression of a creeping thing. Ephesians 4:26 says, “Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation.” To be angry is not a sin, but with it there is the possibility of committing sin. We should not continue in anger but should relinquish it before the sun sets. However, when certain brothers and sisters get angry, they do not let go of it. Because they do not overcome their anger and do not let it go, they have the expression of a creeping thing, not of an eagle.
The situation is the same with believers who are unwilling to forgive those who have offended them. Once certain brothers and sisters are offended by what is spoken to them or what is spoken concerning them, they will refuse to forgive that offense. They may go through their whole life without forgiving the ones who have offended them. Believers who lack the willingness to forgive offenses surely do not have the eagle’s wings, and they certainly cannot coordinate with other saints. Those who do not accept the dealing of the cross and enjoy grace are not able to share in the coordination of the four living creatures.
There are some brothers and sisters who are reluctant to part with and forget such things as their education, money, and career. Therefore, they also have the expression not of an eagle but of a creeping thing. However, one who enjoys grace will count his career or education as loss (Phil. 3:7). Even if he has a doctoral degree, he will count it as refuse (v. 8). Because he is willing to receive the dealing of the cross and because he enjoys grace, he has the eagle’s wings and he can coordinate with others.
Brothers and sisters who do not understand God’s grace and power but do everything in themselves and with their cleverness and natural ability cannot coordinate with others. Those who can coordinate are those who deny themselves, reject themselves, regard themselves as nothing, and trust in God’s grace, power, and work in everything and for everything. These ones can easily coordinate with others. Actually, there is no need for them to endeavor to coordinate; they coordinate spontaneously and effortlessly because they are in God, not in themselves. Those who are in themselves cannot coordinate, but those who are in God can coordinate with ease.</p>

<p>Being a Proper Man
In order to participate in the coordination of the living creatures, we must have the hands of a man. This means that we need to be a proper man. If we are lacking in the proper humanity, there will be problems in our coordination.
This was the situation with a certain brother who insisted on visiting a particular family at a time that was inconvenient for them. The brother was determined to visit this family at meal time, even though the saints in that family felt that meal time was not a suitable time for him to visit. This brother might have had the wings of an eagle, but he did not have the hands of a man. A few days after his visit, we received a report from a family member about what happened. The brother visited the family at lunch time, expecting to be served a meal. However, the wife was sick and could not prepare anything for him to eat. Nevertheless, the brother sat in the house, waiting for lunch to be served, even though the husband was busy caring for his wife and could not provide anything for the visitor to eat. This brother did not have the hands of a man; he did not have the proper humanity. This kind of person cannot coordinate with other saints.
In the vision in Ezekiel 1 we see not only the wings of an eagle but also the hands of a man. The divine revelation shows us that we need to be balanced. No matter how spiritual we may be, we still need to be a proper human. For example, a young brother may be quite spiritual, but when he is with an older person, he must have the proper human respect. If we do not have the hands of a man and if we do not have a balance of spirituality and the proper humanity, we cannot coordinate with others.</p>

<p>Making Us Fervent
Second, the burning of the coordination will make us fervent, intensely hot. Instead of coldness and lukewarmness, everyone will be burned and burning. When others come to the church, they will realize that they cannot stay unless they are willing to be burned. Coordination brings in a real burning, a genuine fervency. This burning will not allow you to be like the church in Laodicea, which was lukewarm, having no fervency, no burning.
Producing Power
Third, the burning in the coordination produces the power and impact of the church. The impact in a local church comes out of the burning. This power is internal and mysterious because it comes from the burning. If you want to have impact, you must be coordinated, and in this coordination you will become burning. Then out of this burning will be the impact and the power. The negative things will be consumed, you will be set on fire, and you will have power and impac</p>

<p>The Sanctifying Fire
Becoming the Sanctifying Light
Whenever the coals are burning, the torches will be shining. This means that the sanctifying fire becomes the sanctifying light. The more the fire burns, the more the light enlightens. If the fire burns us thoroughly, we will be enlightened thoroughly. However, if we do not allow the sanctifying fire to burn us in a certain matter, we will not be enlightened regarding this matter. The areas in which we have been burned by the sanctifying fire spontaneously become the areas in which we are enlightened and concerning which we can enlighten others. If a particular aspect of your character has been burned by the sanctifying fire, in this matter you will be enlightened, and thus you will be able to enlighten others in this matter.
The more intensely the fire burns in the church, the brighter will be the shining in that church. Everything negative will be exposed and burned. In the proper church life there should be nothing of darkness among the brothers and sisters. Every corner should be thoroughly enlightened.</p>

<p>Regarding faith in God, we need to be balanced. Some may claim that since they have faith in the almighty God to supply all their needs, there is no need for them to use their hands to do anything. In particular, they may suppose that there is no need for them to work in a human way. But consider the apostle Paul. Paul was balanced; with him there always were two sides. His writings indicate that he had not only the eagle’s wings but also the hands of a man. He could say that he conducted himself not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God and that the grace of God with him was not in vain. This is the side of the eagle’s wings. However, he also said that he labored more than all the other apostles. We may think that there was no need for Paul to work with his own hands. But Paul took the way of working with his own hands. This indicates that even though he experienced the eagle’s wings, he was still very human in his living, taking the human way and doing things in a human way.
Sometimes the young people may imagine that because they are seeking the Lord, there is no need for them to study hard. They may hope that, even without studying, they may pass their examinations with high grades. This attitude is mistaken. Young people, no matter how much you seek the Lord, love the Lord, and care for the Lord, you still need to be diligent in your studies. This means that no matter how much the grace of God is with us and no matter how much the Lord is empowering us, we must nevertheless fulfill our human duty in our daily living. For instance, we should eat healthy food in the human way and according to human principles. If we do not eat in a proper human way but instead try to behave like an angel, we will get sick. We have to do things in a human way. Under the eagle’s wings there should be human hands, and these hands should always be working. This is to be balanced.
The worldly people, on the contrary, have only the hands of a man; they do not have the wings of an eagle. But many so-called religious people seem to have only the eagle’s wings; they do not have the man’s hands. We need to have both the wings of the Lord’s empowering grace and the hands of a man, cooperating with God in a human way.</p>

<p>In our reading of the four Gospels we may be under the influence of a religious concept that places undue emphasis upon Christ’s divinity. As a result, we may not have the proper appreciation of the Lord’s humanity. When we read in the Gospels how the Lord Jesus manifested His divinity by performing miracles, we may praise the Lord for the power of His divinity. However, when we read in John 13 about how the Lord washed the feet of His disciples, we may not offer any praise. Likewise, when we read about the miracle of the Lord’s feeding more than five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, we may feel that this was something great, but we may have no appreciation for His ordering the people to sit down in groups or for His directing the disciples to gather the broken pieces left over so that nothing would be lost. Such things may make no impression on us. If we know how to read the Gospels in a proper way, we will realize that the glorious beauty of the Lord Jesus is manifested in His humanity. He manifested His glorious beauty not through His divine dignity but through His humanity with its lowliness and tenderness. At the Lord’s table meeting, we need to praise the Lord for His humanity.
Many Christians have been influenced by the concept that it is better to be an angel than to be a man. If you had a choice, which would you prefer to be—an angel or a man? Perhaps many of us would prefer to be an angel. However, God has enough angels, but He is short of men. God does not appreciate angels so much. The angels are His servants. God tells them to go, and they go; He tells them to come, and they come. The angels are also our servants (Heb. 1:13-14). As believers we all have our own angel (Acts 12:12-15). We need to drop the concept that it is better to be an angel than a man. We need to see how glorious and how marvelous it is that we are men.
If we do not desire to be like angels, at least we may desire to be like God. Many Christians are continually striving to be like God. However, God wants to be like us. He even became a man in order to declare God (John 1:18), and today in the heavens the Lord Jesus, who is God, is still a man. There is a man on the throne (Acts 7:56).
The Bible clearly reveals that man is the means for God to manifest Himself. God cannot be manifested without man. Man was created in God’s image in order to be God’s expression. God is the center of the universe, but He needs an expression, and this expression is through man. Without man, God has no expression. The millions of angels cannot be the expression of God. God needs a corporate man to express Him. You should never despise the fact that you are a man.
In the Bible there are actually only four men: the first man, the second man, the new man, and the man-child. We were the first man; Christ is called the second man (1 Cor. 15:47); we have become the new man by regeneration; and now there is the prospect that we may become the man-child. This ministry is not only for the new man but is also for the man-child.
We may talk about the church as the expression of Christ, but we may not realize what the expression of Christ is. The Christ whom the church must express is the man upon the throne. If we would express Christ, we need to realize Christ today is still a man. We do not express merely God; we express God in a man. The church is the expression of Christ. This means that the church is an expression not merely of God but also of a man.
Ezekiel 1:26 shows us that the Lord today is a man on the throne. God needs a man, and eventually He became a man. We as the living creatures express Him as a man. He is the man on the throne, and we also bear the appearance of a man. It is man who fulfills God’s plan, it is man who expresses God, it is man who defeats the enemy, and it is man who brings the kingdom of God into the human race. God needs a man.
The religious teachings in Christianity encourage us either to be like an angel or to be like God. However, the divine revelation unveils that God’s desire is to have a man. We need to remember that the subtle one tempted the first man by telling him that if he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would be like God (Gen. 3:5). From that day the concept of being like God has been in our blood. Every fallen human being has the concept of wanting to be like God. Certain devilish teachings encourage people to be something other than man. But in His redemption and salvation God has no intention of making anything other than man. God’s redemption and God’s salvation are to bring us back to the beginning and to recover us to being a proper man. We are the living creatures and we have God’s life within us, yet we bear the appearance of a man. We should not try to be like an angel. Instead, in whatever we do, in whatever we say, and in whatever we express, we should be a man. This is what God needs today</p>

<p>Some say that it is difficult to be a man and claim that they are disgusted with being a man. Those who have this attitude toward their humanity need to see that their concept is absolutely different from the Lord’s concept in His salvation. The Lord’s salvation is to make us proper men. If you are a husband, the Lord’s salvation is to make you a proper husband. If you are a wife, the Lord’s salvation is to make you a proper wife. If you are a parent, the Lord’s salvation is to make you a proper parent. If you are a child, the Lord’s salvation is to make you a proper child. The Lord’s salvation is to make us proper human beings. Thus, we all should bear the face of a man. However, some Christians, especially certain sisters, do not seem to be human beings. Rather, they are so “spiritual” that it seems that they have become strange creatures—half human, half angel. We need the face of a man. We should not prefer to be something else, and we should not pretend to be something else. We should just be what we are—a man. Instead of trying to be something other than a human being, we should simply be human. However, we should be human not by our natural humanity but by the humanity of the Lord Jesus </p>

Instead of trying to be something other than a human being, we should simply be human. However, we should be human not by our natural humanity but by the humanity of the Lord Jesus.
If we read the four Gospels again, we will see that Jesus was a person with a proper humanity. Many who read the Gospels only pay attention to the miracles worked out by the Lord in His divinity; they do not pay adequate attention to the things worked out by the Lord’s humanity. For example, John 4 relates how the Lord Jesus was traveling with His disciples to a city in Samaria. He was tired and thirsty, and He asked His disciples to go into the city to buy something to eat. After they went away to buy food, a Samaritan woman came to draw water from the well near which the Lord Jesus was sitting. Although He was the Almighty God, in this situation He conducted Himself just like an ordinary man, without any indication or hint that He was God. When He asked the woman for water, He gave no indication that He was anything more than a man. The woman questioned Him, saying, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?” (v. 9). He responded to her question in a very human way. The four Gospels record many similar stories which show us how the Lord Jesus behaved Himself like a normal man, bearing the face of a man. Unlike certain religious people today who dress in way that is very strange, the Lord Jesus did not dress in a peculiar manner. In His clothing He was not strange or different from others. On the contrary, His living was that of an ordinary human being. His living was ordinary to such an extent that some would say, “Is not this the carpenter’s son?” (Matt. 13:55). In the eyes of the people, the Lord Jesus was the son of an ordinary carpenter. Far from being strange, He was an ordinary man and He bore the face of a man. Today, we too need to bear the face of man.
Some believers have the thought that once they begin to pursue the Lord, they should be special or different from others. We need to realize, therefore, that we should be ordinary, that is, we should be the same as common, ordinary human beings. Although we pray, read the Bible, attend the meetings, and serve God, our appearance is still the appearance of a man, and our face is the face of a man. In our dress we are proper, but we are ordinary, not peculiar or eccentric. Yes, we experience the Lord as the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, but the issue of this experience is that we bear the face of a man. As living creatures, we are not angels but are very human. In fact, the more spiritual we become, the more normal and human we will be. The more we have of Christ as our life (Col. 3:4), the more we will bear the face of a man. In the Epistles we are taught by the apostles to be proper human beings, in particular how to be proper husbands, wives, and parents (Eph. 5:22—6:9; Col. 3:18—4:1). God’s salvation causes us to be proper men for His manifestation, move</p>

<ol>
<li>Known by God
before Being Formed in the Womb by Him
In verse 5a God said to Jeremiah, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you." Realizing the poor situation of Israel in relation to Him, God knew Jeremiah even before He purposely formed him in his mother's womb to be a prophet.</li>
<li><p>Sanctified by God
before Coming Forth from the Womb
God also said to Jeremiah, "Before you came forth from the womb, I sanctified you" (v. 5b). How good it is that before Jeremiah was born he was already sanctified!</p></li>
<li><p>As the Resurrected Life-giver,
Producing a Seed
for the Building Up of His Body
as His Continuation
for Jehovah's Pleasure and His Satisfaction
Third, the prophets' report and Jehovah's revelation unveil Christ as the resurrected Life-giver. Isaiah 53:10b-11 says, "When He makes Himself an offering for sin, / He will see a seed, He will extend His days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand. / He will see the issue of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant will make the many righteous, / And He will bear their iniquities." Although the term life-giver is not used in these verses, the thought of a life-giver is implied in the seed mentioned in verse 10. That seed surely is produced by life. Thus, Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is the Life-giver so that He can produce a seed for the building up of His Body as His continuation for Jehovah's pleasure and for His satisfaction. The Father is pleased and Christ is satisfied with the Body of Christ, which is constituted of the seed brought forth by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In 52:13 we were told only that Christ will prosper, but we were not told in what He will prosper. Now, in 53:10 we are told clearly that He will prosper in the pleasure of Jehovah. The pleasure of Jehovah is to reveal Himself into us, to make us the seed of Christ, to make us a part of Christ, to make us the sons of God. This is God's pleasure.</p>

<p>b. Seeing the Issue of the Travail of His Soul
and Being Satisfied
Isaiah 53:11 says, "He will see the issue of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant will make the many righteous, / And He will bear their iniquities." The issue of the travail of Christ's soul refers to the many who are justified (made righteous) by knowing Christ, for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ. Acts 13:39 says, "And from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified." All the justified ones will also be regenerated. They will all become Christ's seed; they will all become the members of His Body to build up the Body as His organism.</p>

<p>A. God's Righteousness Justifying Us
through the Death of Christ
God's righteousness justifies us through the death of Christ (Rom. 10:3; 3:21-22; Gal. 2:16, 21). This is to save us, the sinners, from God's condemnation (Rom. 5:16b, 18a) and also from Satan's death (Rom. 5:12, 21a; John 5:24). As sinners, we have condemnation over us from God and also death within us from Satan. The condemnation of God is dissolved by Christ as the covenant, and the death that comes from Satan is annulled by Christ as the light that issues in life (John 8:12). This is to bring us, the believers, into the divine life that we may become God's heirs to inherit God with all His riches as our divine inheritance (Rom. 5:18b; 8:17a; Gal. 3:29b; Acts 26:18b). These items constitute the substance of the gospel according to the ministry of the apostle Paul in the three books of Romans, Galatians, and 1 Corinthians.</p>

<p>The above matters are the substance of the gospel according to the ministries of the apostles John and Paul. First, John ministered on life, and then Paul ministered on righteousness and life. In his Gospel and in the beginning of his first Epistle, the apostle John did not touch the matter of righteousness. Later in 1 John, he did touch God's righteousness (2:28—3:10). But Paul was different. Paul touched God's righteousness first, then God's life. Romans 5:18 says that God justifies us unto life. Thus, justification brings us into life. When we receive God's justification according to Christ as God's righteousness, the issue in us of this justification is the divine life. Therefore, justification is unto life.</p>

<p>A. Christ as the Covenant to Be
the Salvation of God
The concept of many Christians is that Christ serves God by love, by gentleness, by humility, or by kindness. However, Isaiah was different. Isaiah said that this Servant of Jehovah serves God by being a covenant. The Lord Jesus said that He would serve us by giving up His life (Mark 10:45), that is, by His death. Christ served us by dying for us, and that was to serve us by being a covenant. He said that He was the good Shepherd who would lay down His soulish life for the sheep that He might minister the divine life to them (John 10:10-11). Christ died for us that He might be life to us. These are the two things by which He serves God. He serves God by ministering life to us through His death and resurrection.</p>

<p>Hence, God's righteousness can be seen in the comparison between these two boys, Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael surely did not match God's righteousness. Only Isaac matched God's righteousness. The unique way in which Abraham could receive such a son that equaled God's righteousness was by faith. The apostle Paul said the same thing. He said that we should not endeavor to establish our own righteousness (Rom. 10:3; Phil. 3:9). That would produce Ishmael, and it would never be counted by God as what He desires. We must believe God; then we will receive something from Him, and that something is Christ as today's Isaac. This Christ is the righteousness of God given to us as our righteousness, our acceptance by God, and this eventually becomes the blessing. Today God's intention is to give Himself, embodied in Christ, as everything to us. So we need to receive Him first as our righteousness, then as our life, then as our person, then as our everything, and finally as our inheritance.</p>

<p>In the new covenant it seems that we have received many things, but actually we have gained only one thing—Christ. The old testament established through Moses gave people only a law. But the new testament, the new covenant, established by Christ through His death, gives us Christ. First, this Christ died for our sins to solve all the problems related to God's righteousness. Then, after this death Christ entered into resurrection. In His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit that He might enter into us to enliven us, to germinate us, to animate us, to make us alive. Although Christ's death justifies us, we are still dead persons. By itself, Christ's death cannot impart life to us to make us alive that we may enjoy all the issues of God's justification. After God justified us, He desired to give us many blessings; but if we were still dead persons, it would be impossible for us to enjoy all His blessings as our inheritance. Hence, Christ needed to take a further step, the step of resurrection. In the resurrection that followed His death, Christ became a life-giving Spirit. It is altogether right for us to say that He became a life-imparting Spirit, even a life-dispensing Spirit, because the giving of life is the impartation of life, and the impartation of life is the dispensing of life. As such a Spirit, Christ entered into us to enliven us, to bring life into us, to impart the divine life into us to make us alive. In this way we were regenerated to be God's children, to be no longer merely justified sinners but children of God.</p>

<p>Initially, life was in God, having nothing to do with us. But through Christ's death, we were cleansed; we were justified; we were forgiven. Yet we were still dead persons. Then Christ became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection to impart, to dispense, the very life which was in God into us, to enliven us, to regenerate us, to make us children of God, to make us those who are born of God and are no longer merely a justified corpse. We were enlivened; we were regenerated; we were born again to be the children of God.</p>

<p>Romans 8:17 says that as children of God, we are also heirs of God to inherit God as our everything. This means that we will inherit God as our inheritance. Many times the Old Testament, especially the book of Jeremiah, says that Israel will be God's people and He will be their God. The New Testament, in 2 Corinthians 6:16, quotes this word. For us to be God's people means that we are God's inheritance, and for God to be our God means that He is our inheritance. Before this mutual inheritance existed, both God and we, we and God, were poor. Before we had God, we had nothing, and before God had us, He was childless. That was the reason that He desired to dispense Himself into us, to make us all His children; and all His children are now His inheritance. Now God is rich. By this we can understand the significance of this simple word: "I will be your God, and you will be My people." Today, as the children of God, we have Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of God. This God who is embodied in Christ is our life, our person, and our inheritance. Likewise, God also has an inheritance. We are His inheritance.
This is all due to two things: Christ as our covenant and Christ as our light. Christ as our covenant takes care of God's righteousness, and Christ as our light releases God's life into us. We have Christ as our covenant; thus, we have no problem with God's righteousness. We also have Christ as our light; hence, we are rich in the divine life. Now, based on the righteousness of God and in the life of God, we enjoy God as our inheritance. This, in totality, is God's full salvation to us.</p>

<p>If there were no righteousness, there would be no faithfulness. Thus, the foundation of the New Jerusalem is the righteousness of God with God's faithfulness.</p>

<p>God's full salvation is a composition of God's righteousness as the base and God's life as the consummation. This is the revelation of the Bible.</p>

<p>Ultimately, God's full salvation is Christ as the covenant plus Christ as the light, and this is the composition of the New Jerusalem. God's full salvation is based on His righteousness and is consummated in His life. Christ as the covenant takes care of God's righteousness. Hence, that covenant is the foundation of God's salvation. Then Christ as the light carries out God's salvation to consummate God's salvation in life. Thus, Christ as the covenant and Christ as the light, added together, equal God's full salvation.</p>

<p>In the universe, between God and man, God always does something first. Then man reacts to what God does. Then God comes in to react to man's reaction. This is somewhat like a cycle, like the exchanging of words between husband and wife. The husband speaks to the wife, and the wife reacts. Then the husband reacts to his wife's reaction. A similar exchange of words often takes place between God and man. God may tell us that we should love Him, and we may respond by saying that we are not able to love Him. Then God may say that He will be the strength for us to love Him, but we may say that we do not know how to apply this strength. This cycle of action and reaction can be stopped only by our realizing that we are not the head. We are not the one who has the right to say yes or no. This is submission.</p>

<p>"Indeed, in the path of Your judgments,/O Jehovah, we have waited for You" (26:8a). This indicates that while the Lord is judging, we should wait for Him in the path of His judging. While the Lord is chastening us, we need to learn something of Him and find out the lesson that the Lord would give us. However, some saints, after being chastened by the Lord, seem to learn nothing. They waste both their time and the Lord's chastening. Whenever we are chastened by the Lord, we need to learn something of Him. This is to wait for Him in the path of His judgment.</p>

<p>Verses 8b and 9 continue, "Your name, that is, Your memorial,/Is the desire of our soul./My soul desires You in the night;/Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You at the dawn;/For when Your judgments are in the earth,/The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness." God's judgment always teaches us lessons in righteousness.</p>

<p>B. The Sparrow Finding a Home
and the Swallow a Nest for Herself
Where She May Lay Her Young
at the Two Altars
The psalmist goes on to liken himself to the sparrow and the swallow: "At Your two altars, even the sparrow has found a home;/And the swallow, a nest for herself,/Where she may lay her young,/O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God" (v. 3). These two altars are the golden altar for incense and the brass altar of burnt offering (Exo. 40:5-6). The brass altar, on which all kinds of offerings were offered, was in the outer court before the door of the tabernacle. The laver was also in the outer court. In the Holy Place were the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the golden altar for incense.</p>

<p>As believers in Christ today, we need both the divine life and the human life. If we do not have the divine life, we do not have life. But if we do not have the proper human life to match the divine life, we will have no fruit. The New Testament reveals that, as those chosen and predestinated by God, we need to have the divine life expressed in our human living. If we have this, then in our experience we will have Christ both as the Shoot of Jehovah and as the Fruit of the earth.</p>

<p>B. Rejecting Him by Asking Him to Wait
until Her Down Situation Is Over
"Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away,/Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young hart/On the mountains of Bether" (v. 17). Here she rejects Him by asking Him to wait until her down situation is over and then to turn to her in His resurrection, like a gazelle or a young hart, at the time of their separation, which could be removed only by Him and not by her (on the mountains of Bether). The word Bether means "separation." The lover seemed to be saying to Him, "Lord, I am not ready. Please do not come now but wait until my situation is over. Be like a gazelle upon the mountain of separation." This separation, this mountain, is a problem, and it can be removed only by Him.
 C. In Her Introspection She Seeking Her Beloved
but Failing to Find Him
"On my bed night after night/I sought him whom my soul loves;/I sought him, but found him not" (3:1). In her introspection, in her down situation, she seeks her Beloved, but she fails to find Him.</p>

<p>B. The Ones Who Watch Over God's People
in the Ways of the Heavenly Jerusalem Finding Her
"The watchmen who go about in the city found me—/Have you seen him whom my soul loves?" (v. 3). The ones who watch over God's people spiritually (Heb. 13:17) in the ways of the heavenly Jerusalem find her, and she asks them if they have seen the One whom she loves.
C. Finding Her Beloved and Holding Him
"Scarcely had I passed them/When I found him whom my soul loves;/I held him and would not let go/Until I had brought him into my mother's house/And into the chamber of her who conceived me" (S.S. 3:4). Not long after she leaves the ones who watch over God's people, she finds her Beloved, and she holds Him and will not let go until she brings Him into the Spirit of grace, through which she was regenerated (mother's house—chamber—Heb. 10:29; Gal. 4:26; Eph. 2:4-5; Gal. 5:4) for secret fellowship.</p>

<p>Although the lover of Christ fell into introspection, one day she woke up and realized that she was a sinner saved by grace. Then she could say, "God loved me and Christ saved me by grace." Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit brings God's love and carries God's grace to us. Hence, the Spirit is called the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29). Once the lover realized that she was a sinner saved by grace, she was revived. Then finding her Beloved, she held him and would not let go. She brought Christ to her mother's house, where she was born by grace, and to the chamber, where she was conceived in love. As the chamber is the inward part of the house, so God's love is the inward part of Christ's grace. As saved ones, we have both the love of God and the grace of Christ.</p>

<p>Then the self rises up, and the lover of Christ begins to care only for being perfect. This is the self.</p>

<p>The self is very subtle. In Matthew 16, after the Lord Jesus unveiled the way of the cross for the accomplishment of God's economy, Peter showed his love for the Lord by saying, "God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!" (v. 22). Peter thought that was his own word. Actually, Peter spoke from his self, which had become one with Satan. The Lord Jesus rebuked Peter saying, "Get behind Me, Satan!" (v. 23a). Then the Lord spoke about denying the self (v. 24). This reveals that the self is the satanic humanity; it is man possessed and usurped by Satan. As a result, man in his fallen humanity cares only for himself. Because everyone is for himself, selfishness is seen in all kinds of relationships—between husband and wife, between children and parents, between employers and employees.</p>

<p>We may have some success in pursuing after Christ and may attain a certain amount of satisfaction. But then we may ask, "How can I maintain this? How can I keep myself in this condition?" At this point the self comes in.</p>

<p>Self comes in under the false cloak of introspection. Actually, self is constituted with introspection. Introspection is to examine yourself by looking into yourself. The Bible teaches us to always look away unto Jesus (Heb. 12:2). We should not look at ourselves. Our self is not worthy to look at. Nevertheless, every spiritual person who reaches a situation of satisfaction in Christ eventually falls into introspection, not only examining the self but also analyzing it. When I was a young believer, I looked at myself quite often. I did not like to do anything that would not glorify the Lord. But actually I was not caring for the Lord; I was caring for myself and for what others thought of me. Looking into ourselves in this way is the greatest weakness in the spiritual life and the greatest enemy.
In helping others who are seeking to be spiritual, we may encourage them to pray and to confess their shortcomings to the Lord. Such prayer and confession are normal. However, in some cases we should encourage others to cease from confessing and simply believe that the blood of Jesus cleanses them and that God is faithful and righteous to forgive them (1 John 1:7, 9), reminding them that God is faithful to honor Christ's redemption.</p>

<p>When we are introspective, we may confess the same matter again and again, thinking that the more we confess, the more forgiveness we will receive. This kind of confession comes from the satanic self; it is the result of analyzing ourselves in spiritual things. Only the cross of Christ can deliver us from such a situation caused by introspection. Therefore, we need to be called to be delivered from the self through our oneness with the cross. When we become one with the cross, hiding ourselves in the clefts of the rock and in the covert of the precipice, we will be delivered from the self.</p>

<p>D. Looking through the Windows and
Glancing through the Lattice
"He is looking through the windows,/He is glancing through the lattice" (v. 9c). The windows and the lattice signify the openings set up by God for Him to fellowship, to commune, with her. No matter how much we try to hide ourselves secretly, there is a window that Christ can see through. Because man became fallen, there seemed to be no way for God to touch man or have fellowship with man. But the conscience of man is the window with a lattice, which is open for God to come in to contact fallen man. We should keep this in mind when we go out to preach the gospel. As we are preaching the gospel, we need to learn how to touch others' conscience.</p>

<p>F. Christ's Eagerness in Asking
His Lover to Get Away from Her Introspection
of the Self to Be with Him
"Rise up, my love,/My beauty, and come away" (v. 13b). This repeated word indicates Christ's eagerness in asking His lover to get away from her introspection of the self to be with Him. However, it is not easy for one to come out of introspection. It is very difficult to help a brother or sister who is introspective. Sometimes it takes a year or more before such a one can be helped to get away from the introspection of the self.</p>

<p>B. Christ Charging His Lover to Be Aware
of Her Peculiarities, Habits, and Introspections
Which Ruin the Resurrection for His Lover
"Catch the foxes for us,/The little foxes,/That ruin the vineyards/While our vineyards are in blossom" (S.S. 2:15). Christ charges His lover to be aware of her peculiarities, habits, and introspections (little foxes) which ruin the resurrection for His lover (our vineyards in blossom).</p>

<p>The little foxes that ruin the vineyards signify our peculiarities, our habits, and our introspections, and the vineyards signify the church life. To be spiritual is good, but it often leads to peculiarity. Nearly every spiritual person is peculiar, having some kind of peculiar streak. When we become peculiar, we are no longer spiritual. Instead, we become a trouble to the church. The deliverance from peculiarity is the cross.</p>

<p>However, in the five psalms covered in this message, we cannot see anything of such a kind of spirituality. Instead, these psalms only cover the psalmist's praises to God for God's goodness to him, his concern for the safety of his person and for prosperity in his affairs, God's care for the psalmist, and the psalmist's trust in God. All these are good things. But good things often become the replacement of the best, the opposition against the best, and even the enemy to the best. Many seekers of the Lord are held back by these kinds of good things and would not seek the Lord further for His best that they might participate in the life-giving Spirit's bountiful supply for them to live and magnify Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12, 16) and for the accomplishing of God's eternal purpose.
Hence, in studying the Psalms, on the one hand, we should receive all the marvelous revelations concerning Christ as the centrality and universality of God's economy, but, on the other hand, we should discern that the Psalms are pious expressions of the psalmists uttered out of their natural concepts, and some are based on the principle of good and evil, not on the principle of the divine life. All of these expressions are far below the standard of the requirements of God's new creation (Gal. 6:15).</p>

<p>The top psalms we have seen thus far are Psalm 2, Psalm 8, and Psalm 16. Now we come to the fourth top psalm, Psalm 22.</p>

<p>Thus far in our fellowship, we have seen four major stations concerning Christ—Psalms 2, 8, 16, and 22—24</p>

<ol>
<li>Tasting and Seeing That God Is Good
Psalm 34:8 says, "Taste and see that Jehovah is good." I did not see before that this verse is in the portion of the Psalms which reveals the enjoyment of God in God's house. This kind of tasting and seeing must be in the house of God. God is in His house. If we are not in His house, how can we taste Him and see Him? We taste and see that God is good in His house, that is, in Christ, in the church, and eventually in the New Jerusalem.</li>
</ol>

<p>We should not forget Genesis 1, Psalm 8, and Hebrews 2. These three portions cover the three stages of man.</p>

<p>We should not forget Genesis 1, Psalm 8, and Hebrews 2. These three portions cover the three stages of man.</p>

<p>2 Kings 18—20
The best reign of all the kings was that of Hezekiah over Judah. In this message we will first consider the reign of Hezekiah and then speak further concerning the intrinsic connection between the books of history in the Old Testament and their fulfillment in the New Testament.
I. REIGNING FOR TWENTY-NINE YEARS
Hezekiah began to reign at the age of twenty-five, in the third year of Hoshea king of Israel, and reigned for twenty- nine years in Jerusalem (18:1-2).
II. DOING WHAT WAS
RIGHT IN THE SIGHT OF JEHOVAH
Verses 3 through 6 show us that Hezekiah did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done. Hezekiah removed the high places, broke down the pillars, and cut down the Asherah. Also, he broke in pieces the bronze serpent made by Moses which Hezekiah called Nehushtan (meaning "a piece of bronze") and to which the children of Israel burned incense. Moses, according to God's instructions, had made that bronze serpent in order to rescue the people from death. However, in their superstition they eventually regarded the bronze serpent as an idol, and for this reason Hezekiah broke it in pieces. Hezekiah clung to Jehovah and did not turn away from following Him but kept His commandments and trusted in Him, so that after him there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, nor anyone who was before him.</p>
